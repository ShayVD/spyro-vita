# Hardware runs for the render thread, the XA read-ahead and the opaque path (D63–D66)

These replace the "measure first" runs of `docs/fps-plan.md` (Phase 0). Each file here is a whole
`ux0:data/spyro/config.txt`: copy one over it (keep a copy of your own first), start the game, do
what the run says, quit, and send back `ux0:data/spyro/spyro.log` renamed after the run
(`a1-off.log`, ...). Don't open the options menu during a run: it rewrites `config.txt` with its
rows (the lines here stay, but the run's picture settings would be the menu's).

All runs use the same VPK, the one from this PR. Since D68 the three switches are on by default
(`render_thread=1`, `xa_ahead=1`, `gpu_opaque=1`) and `gpu_time` is 0. The files set each switch
the run needs, and they carry `config_version=3`: without it a `=0` for one of the switches is
taken as an old file's and ignored (D68).

| File | Switches | Do |
|---|---|---|
| `a1-off.txt` | `gpu_time=2`, all three off: as main | 3–5 minutes of play: Artisans (around the castle and the hedges), then one busy level (Stone Hill, or Town Square in Peace Keepers). The same route in A2 and A3 |
| `a2-threads.txt` | `gpu_time=2`, `render_thread=1`, `xa_ahead=1` | the same route |
| `a3-all.txt` | as A2, plus `gpu_opaque=1` | the same route |
| `b1-off.txt` | `bench=2`, 60 fps forced (`interp=1`, `interp_budget=0`), all three off | leave it alone from boot for ~3.5 minutes: it cycles 18 picture option sets through the intro, title and attract demos, then puts the options back |
| `b2-all.txt` | as B1, with all three on | the same |
| `c1-all.txt` | 60 fps with the default budget, `gpu_time=2`, all three on | 2 minutes of play in Artisans |
| `c2-all-nobudget.txt` | as C1 with `interp_budget=0`: every tick gets its in-between frame | the same |
| `d1-60fps.txt` | 60 fps as the menu gives it since D68: the defaults, the budget's hold, no GPU timing | the C1 route: Artisans, then the heavier level |
| `h1-parse-30.txt` | the defaults at 30 fps, plus `parse_thread=1` (D71) | the D1 route: Artisans, then the heavier level. Run D1 again first if you have no D1 log from this VPK |
| `h2-parse-60.txt` | D1 (the menu's 60 FPS), plus `parse_thread=1` | the D1 route |
| `h3-parse-core3.txt` | H2 with `parse_core=3`: the parse thread on core 3, if the start-up check allows it | the D1 route; only worth it if the `cores:` line says core 3 is usable |

## What each run shows

The lines are every 300 vblanks (5 s). Compare windows of the same place on the route.

**A1 against A2: the render thread and the read-ahead at 30 fps.**
- `time N:` (the game thread). `raster` should fall from ~4.8 ms per vblank to almost nothing, `ot` by about `expand()`'s share (the `atlas` line's expand ms divided by 300), and `spu` by most of the file-system time. `busy %` should fall from 93–94% to about 50–60% in the heavy windows (*estimate*). In A2 the game's waits for the render thread are inside `wait`.
- `render N:` (A2 only). The render thread's busy ms per vblank and per picture, and the game thread's waits by reason. "previous frame not shown yet" is the time the game waited because the GL thread or the GPU was behind. "sync calls" should be small, except around loads and the pause menu.
- `xa N:` (A2 only). Almost every music sector should come from the read-ahead. The `cd:` line's file-system ms then grows only with level loads.
- `vblank N: ... pictures, ... vblanks late`. At least as many pictures, and no more late vblanks than A1.
- `gpu N: gpu_time=2: the timed frame's scene took the GPU S ms`: the GPU's own time for the picture (Run A of `docs/fps-plan.md`). It shouldn't change between A1 and A2. It decides how far 60 fps can go: ≤ 12 ms, the GPU has room; 12–16, close; > 16, the GPU is the limit.
- `mixer N:`. The mix is unchanged, and the mismatches stay 0.

**A2 against A3: the opaque path.**
- `atlas N: gpu_opaque=1: K of those triangles drawn without discard` (A3 only): how many it applies to.
- The scene time S and the `timed frame`'s tail. If S doesn't fall by at least ~1 ms in the heavy windows, the opaque path doesn't pay and stays off.
- The picture must look the same. If anything looks different with A3 (a hole, a dark edge, a wrong colour), say where.

**B1 against B2: the bench at 60 fps.**
- `bench final:` lines: pictures/s (60 at most) for each option set, with an in-between frame every tick. 16:9 `ps1` against 16:9 native is the same CPU with 4.3 times fewer pixels: what's left between them in B2 is the GPU's share.

**C1 and C2: 60 fps in play, everything on.**
- `present N:`: in-between frames per window, and how many the budget skipped. With the render thread, the budget also counts the render thread's time per picture (D63). C1 shows how often 60 fps fits.
- C2: with every in-between frame forced, `render N:`'s "previous frame not shown yet" and the late vblanks give the real overrun. That's whether the GPU or the render thread is the limit at 60 fps.

**D1: 60 fps as shipped (D68).**
- `present N:`: "falls to a held 30 fps" counts the misses. In a place where 60 fits (Artisans in C1) there should be few or none, and almost every tick has its in-between frame. Where it doesn't fit (C1's heavier level, GPU scene 19–31 ms) the picture should stay at a steady 30: the in-between frames near 0 and a fall or two per window, not C1's mix of 20–120 in-between frames per window.
- No hitch every 5 seconds: `gpu_time` is 0, so there's no `timed frame` line and no `glFinish`.
- The start-up's `gpu: shaders compiled in N ms` line says how long the boot's shader compile takes (C1's two "still waiting (sync calls)" lines at vblank 0 were that compile, more than 10 s).
- The first D1 run (VPK from `131dde2`) never came back from its hold after the first level change: the release test held the render thread to the game thread's budget. Fixed in D68's follow-up, so rerun D1 with a VPK built after it.

**H1, H2 and H3: the parse thread (D71), against D1 (and a 30 fps run without it).**
- `cores:` at start (every run, not just E): whether a thread of ours may run on core 3 (`SCE_KERNEL_CPU_MASK_SYSTEM`), on which CPU it ran, and what share of a 50 ms spin it had. Expected: refused, or not usable (the system keeps that core).
- `parse:` at start: the thread's core and priority, or why it's off.
- `parse N:` (E only): lists walked on the parse thread, its busy ms per vblank, the copy (KB, and ms per vblank on the game thread), how long the game thread waited for the walk at its joins, and packets outside the copy. **Packets outside the copy must be 0.**
- `time N:` against D1 at the same place: `ot` is now the copy plus the waits for the walk (it was the walk itself: 1.5–2.6 ms per vblank in C1's busy windows). `busy %` should fall by about that much less the copy.
- `present N:` (H2, H3): in-between frames. The parse thread only helps the game thread; where the GPU is the limit (C1's heavier level) 60 fps still won't hold.
- `mixer N:` and `xa N:`: with the walk on core 1 beside the mixer and the read-ahead, the mixer's worst ms and `audio queue dry` mustn't rise, and the read-ahead should still cover every music sector.

## What to look for that would mean a bug

- Anything on screen that differs between the runs at the same place: a missing or late picture, flicker, a wrong pause or inventory background, a menu panel that doesn't show.
- A `render: still waiting` line: the game thread waited 5 s for the render thread. (At start-up the
  shader compile logs `render: GPU start-up still running after N s` instead: expected.)
- `render N: ... unknown` above 0.
- A crash or hang at start (the shaders now compile on the render thread), at a level load or when the pause menu opens.
- With `parse_thread=1`: a `parse: still waiting` line, `packets outside the copy` above 0, a picture that's a frame behind or shows the wrong frame's HUD, or a pause or inventory background that's wrong.
- With `render_thread=1`, a save state saved and loaded (the options menu's SAVE section) not putting you back where you were.
