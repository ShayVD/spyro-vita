# Decisions, part 2

Decisions from D103 on; D1–D102 are in [decisions.md](decisions.md). Record each decision with its date, what was chosen, and why.

## 2026-11-05 — hardware runs

### D103. Hardware runs use vita-port-kit's scripts; this game's details are in `tools/vita/hw.game`
- **Why and what:** see `docs/vita-testing.md` "Hardware runs from the Mac". The scripts are vendored in `third_party/vita-port-kit`, and `tools/vita/hw_*` wrap them. The lock moved to `~/.cache/vita-port-kit` and is shared with kh1-decomp. Checked against the mock (2026-11-05); not run on hardware yet.
